rendezvous

There is too much ambiguity when creating plans using social media or text messages. Social media outlets, such as Facebook, do not facilitate immediate responses and allow for responders to mark maybe as an option. This makes it difficult for the creator to establish concrete plans for an event. On the other hand, when using texting to decide on plans, if a user does not wish to attend, they are still trapped in the flow of messages that no longer apply to them.

Our solution is to create an app that allows users to plan events that will have users respond immediately, while eliminating unnecessary information from reaching users who are not interested. This will be done by the event organizer sending out the details of the event via sms to the invited users with the options ‘attend’ and ‘don’t attend’. The results will be displayed back to the event organizer which allows them to make an educated decision on how to continue with the event.
